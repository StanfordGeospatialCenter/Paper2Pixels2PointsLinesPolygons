### Curating a collection of maps

In this section, we will explore the process of curating a collection of maps for georeferencing and digitizing cartographic data. The suitability of maps for georeferencing depends on several factors, including the quality and clarity of the map, the presence of identifiable control points, and the overall condition of the physical map. 

Additionally, the scale of the maps should be appropriate for the features you intend to digitize. Large-scale maps are generally more suitable for detailed digitization of small features, while small-scale maps may be better for capturing broader geographic areas.

When selecting maps, it is crucial to consider copyright and access issues. Ensure that the maps are either in the public domain or that you have the necessary permissions to use them. 

Many institutions provide access to high-quality map images through the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), which can be a valuable resource. In this workshop, we will leverage collections through their IIIF endpoints, for use in other platforms.

By carefully curating your map collection with these considerations in mind, you can ensure a more accurate georeferencing and digitizing process.

### Using Media Groups on David Rumsey Map Collection

David Rumsey Map Collection is an excellent resource for accessing a vast array of historical maps. One of the features that can aid in curating maps for your project is the use of media groups. Media groups allow you to organize and manage maps based on specific themes, time periods, or geographic areas.

To create a media group on davidrumsey.com, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: First, you need to create an account on the David Rumsey Map Collection website. This will allow you to save and organize your selected maps.

2. **Search for Maps**: Use the search functionality to find maps that are relevant to your project. You can search by keywords, dates, map titles, or geographic locations.

3. **Add Maps to Media Group**: Once you find a map you want to include, click on the map to view its details. You will see an option to add the map to a media group. You can create a new media group or add the map to an existing one.

4. **Organize Your Media Groups**: After adding maps to your media groups, you can organize them by renaming the groups, adding descriptions, and rearranging the order of maps within each group. This helps in keeping your collection structured and easily accessible.

5. **Access and Share Media Groups**: You can access your media groups from your account dashboard. Additionally, you can share your media groups with others by providing a link, making collaboration easier.

By utilizing media groups on the David Rumsey Map Collection website, you can efficiently curate and manage a collection of maps tailored to your specific needs, enhancing the georeferencing and digitizing process.
